Touch Designer Project for capturing and looping video

What does it do?
This is a video live looper which functions in much the same way as a audio loop pedal but for video.
Built in Touch Designer, this project can be used to play clips out of the computer while at the same time capturing back into the computer.
This process can be repeated to oversample the video.

Why did I build it?
I'm a video glitch artist that experiements with video circuits using old video equipment.
I started this project because I wanted a way to capture the manipulations I was introducing to the video signal using the old video equipment and then manipulate that captured video again, and again...
I'm also into live looping audio as a beatboxer, so I took the existing concepts from audio world as the guide to build my video looper.
I originally tried to achieve the technique using existing technologies. I started with Resolume (famous VJ software) and then OBS (open source live streaming software) but I couldn't get instantanious results I was us used to with audio loop pedals.
After considering different approaches I decided to use Touch Designer.

Now:
I've very much built this for my specific needs. I mentioned my beatboxing...
So I take my beatboxing loops, load them into this patch, which sets the duration that video will be captured into cache.
There are 2 cache's, I can flip which one is being updated with incoming video while the other one plays out, I oversample this to my hearts content flipping the cache over until I commit and record from the cache the to a file that lands on my desktop.
I then have a audio visual loop that I can upload to socials etc.

..and Next
Currently it's based around creating visuals for a single timed audio loop, I will be expanding the patch to be used for a whole song structure by using more caches and triggering them in sequence.
I'll be introducing video effects too. Simple stuff that can be further manipulated with my video kit.

Any Bugs:
The loops have a bit of drift, perhaps 4 frames by the time I've commited to recording to file.
When I have the time I'll dig deeper to find solutions.

Installation:
Install Touch Designer
More steps coming soon

How To Use:
I'll record a Youtube Video Soon
